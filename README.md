# Password-Generator-Zoran

This week's Challenge required me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. 

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. 

It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. 
The password does include special characters
